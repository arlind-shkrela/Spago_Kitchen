##### ASP.Net Core Web API + React + SQLServer 

Hello World - The Purpose of this application (ongoing) is simple:
#To give you a glace a combined skills of myself, front and back end. The project is small but enough to demonstrate my proficiency on those areas and how I structure my code.
#A million-dollar question: Angular or React? There you will find the same result using two different popular front-end languages.
#An asp.net web api develeped in VS Code is sitting in behind serving those requests.
#SQL Server and MySQL
#AutoMapper
#Entity Framework
#Docker
#Azure Blob Storage
#DevOps CI/CD Pipline
#React
#Angular

My Goal: Understand my function within 5 seconds. Otherwise call me to refactor together :)
